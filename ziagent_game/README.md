Homework #4: Games in a Population of ZI Agents

Part A: Instantiate a population of 100-1000 agents and have them play one of the games described in class that does not have a dominant strategy (e.g., coordination, battle of the sexes, chicken). Initially the agents have random strategies. Treat them as innocent of the actual payoffs and of game theoretic-type reasoning (e.g., about dominant strategies). Code them to ‘grope’ for better payoffs. That is they play their current strategy a few times and see what kinds of payoffs they get. They occasionally sample other strategies. They cannot observe other agents playing the game but they have perfect memory of their past plays. The population co- evolves. Run your model long enough that some steady-state is attained. Describe that steady- state.

Part B: Run your model multiple times with the same population size and for the same game. Characterize the run-to-run variation you observe.

Part C: Do your agents arrive at either pure or mixed strategy Nash equilibria? Is it reasonable to say that agent-level equilibria emerge in your model runs? Do social norms arise? Can you imagine long run configurations of your model that are different from what you obtained.

Part D: How do your results depend on the number of agents? Phrase your answer in terms of the speed of convergence, stability of steady-state, character of the transient dynamics, and so on
